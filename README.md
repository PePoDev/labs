# PePoLabs

PePoLabs is my lab of things when I practice in technology and tools. But I tend to forget and think of it over time, so the aim is to double check and do the same thing again to learn and teach others.
Most laboratories use Terraform to automate their prepared environments. Also, check out the Terraform lab first if you don't already know it.
